## Task 3

Add folders: `/exercise1/task3/` under the root directory `/var/www/html/`

Copy the files from this directory into this folder. (For the design: copy also the bootstrap files in `/var/www/html/excercise1/bootstrap`)

To enable the apache service to create the message.txt file, the ownership of the directory has to be altered: `sudo chown www-data /var/www/html/exercise1/task3/`
